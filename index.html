                <p> I'm 18 years old and a half, as of now. Well i'm just a typical guy, i'm shy to all which gives you a thought of me as a weird and odd guy. I'm also funny guy and my perception in life is different from others though we all have different point of view on it. I'm from Occi. Mindoro. My mother left me when i was 24 months old, I'm living with my Father.

                    <br> " The meaning of life isn't happiness, It doesn’t matter what you do in life “as long as it makes you happy”. This is ridiculous. Happiness is the easy emotion. It takes no effort. When you’re happy, you’re happy. The world is wonderful. The sun is shining, birds are chirping, and double rainbows are making you completely lose your shit out of excitement. Happiness is a drug. It makes you feel amazing for a while, but the effects are temporary and you will do anything for another fix. That’s just life. It goes round and round. Don’t chase happiness. Ultimately, it will leave you unhappy. " </p>
